# Sonic Universe 🎮

Welcome to **Sonic Universe**, the first high-performance Web3 gaming platform built on **Solana** using the **Sonic SVM** and powered by the **HyperGrid** framework. Sonic Universe redefines the traditional gaming experience by enabling **sovereign game economies** where players can truly own and trade their in-game assets. Dive into a world of arcade-style games with simple mechanics that are fun, competitive, and replayable!

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Sonic Universe Gaming Ecosystem** is designed to bring together a collection of games under one platform. Each game is an independent module, powered by unique smart contracts and seamlessly integrated with its client-side applications. Our goal is to provide a unified gaming experience that emphasizes **fun**, **virality**, and **ownership**.

### 🌟 Sonic SVM Highlights
- **Built for Web3 Gaming**: Sonic SVM is optimized for high-performance games that leverage decentralized game economies.
- **Concurrent Scaling**: Using **HyperGrid**, Sonic Universe can support multiple games running in parallel with minimal friction, ensuring fast and responsive gameplay.
- **In-Game Asset Ownership**: Players can truly own and trade their game assets, creating a sovereign economy for each game.

## 🗂️ Repo Structure

This repository is divided into two main sections:

### 1. **Smart Contracts**
All game logic and core functionalities are handled by **Solana smart contracts**. Each game has its own folder/program in this section, ensuring modularity and ease of development.

- **`contracts/`**: Contains all the smart contracts, each representing the logic for a specific game or in-game feature.
  - Example: `riddle_game_contract/`, `arcade_challenge_contract/`
  
These contracts handle everything from **game mechanics** to **token interactions**, providing a secure and transparent system for players to engage with.

### 2. **Clients**
The **clients section** is responsible for interacting with the smart contracts and the Sonic Universe platform's APIs. Each game has a dedicated client that allows users to connect, play, and engage with the ecosystem.

- **`clients/`**: Contains the frontend code and APIs for user interaction. Every client is tailored to a specific game.
  - Example: `riddle_game_client/`, `arcade_challenge_client/`
  
Each client communicates with its corresponding smart contract to ensure smooth gameplay and secure transactions.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Before you dive into any game, make sure to connect your Solana-compatible wallet to the platform.
2. **Choose a Game**: Browse the Sonic Universe platform to find a game you'd like to play, ranging from riddles to arcade challenges.
3. **Engage with Smart Contracts**: Once in-game, every interaction, from starting a challenge to claiming rewards, is securely processed through smart contracts.
4. **Own Your Assets**: As you play, you can earn or purchase in-game assets, which are stored as NFTs or tokens, giving you true ownership of your items.
